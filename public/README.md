Todo Application - Frontend

This is the front end of my Todo Application. It is designed to help with keeping on top of daily work or even porjects, it contains a date due and an urgent tab. The app doesn't allow you to remove the task until you have completed it. So, no cheating! 

It was built throughout the Tech Returners Your Journey Into Tech course. It integrates with a backend, https://github.com/Fatima-DR/ToDo_backend .

The hosted version of the application is available here: https://fatima-dr.github.io/ToDo-List-Frontend-with-react/
